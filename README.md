# Sudoku-difficulty-tester

As yet unfinished.
Currently the program can generate a random sudoku and solve it. 

I am currently working on a way to calculate the difficulty of the sudoku, with the aim of generating a sudoku of a set difficulty. 
This will be done by solving the sudoku using "human" methods, and calculating the number of possible steps of various types at each stage of the puzzle.
