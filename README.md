# Sudoku-difficulty-tester

As yet unfinished.
Currently the program can generate a random sudoku and solve it. 

I am currently working on a way to calculate the difficulty of the sudoku, with the aim of generating a sudoku of a set difficulty. 
This will be done by solving the sudoku using "human" methods, and calculating the number of possible steps of various types at each stage of the puzzle.


## Python prototyping

In order to start up Jupyter Lab, run the following command:
jupyter lab

## GraphQL Backend

Ideally use IntelliJ.

Run the java app C:\stash\Sudoku-difficulty-tester\graphQL
Then the API should be available at http://localhost:8080/graphql

## React Front End

Ideally use Rider or VSCode

Run `npm start`, then the Web App should be available at http://localhost:3000/
